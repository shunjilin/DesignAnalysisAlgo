Shortened from Coursera:

Code up the greedy algorithm on Huffman coding.

The file 'huffman.txt' has the format:

[number of symbols]

[weight of symbol 1]

[weight of symbol 2]

...

Run the Huffman coding algorithm on this data set.

Q1. What is the maximum length of a codeword in the resulting Huffman code?
Q2. What is the minimum length of a codeword in the resulting Huffman code?
