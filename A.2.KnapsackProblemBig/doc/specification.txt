Shortened from Coursera:

Code up the knapsack algorithm.

The file describes a knapsack instance and has the following format:

[knapsack_size][number_of_items]

[value_1][weight_1]

[value_2][weight_2]

...

Assume all numbers are positive.
Assume that item weights and the knapsack capacity are integers.

For bigger problem, requires recursion and caching of subproblems.
