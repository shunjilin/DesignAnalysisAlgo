Code up the clustering algorithm for computing a max-spacing-k-clustering

The file 'clustering1.txt' describes a distance function - a complete graph with edge costs.
It has the format:

[number_of_nodes]

[edge 1 node 1][edge 1 node 2]
[edge 1 cost]

[edge 2 node 1][edge 2 node 2]
[edge 2 cost]

There is one edge (i,j) for each choice of 1<=1<=j<=n, where n is the number of nodes.
You can assume distances are positive, but you cannot assume that they are distinct.

Task is to run the clustering algorithm on this data set, where the target number k of
clusters is 4. What is the maximum spacing of a 4-clustering?
