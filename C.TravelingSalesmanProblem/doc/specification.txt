Implement algorithm for the Traveling Salesman Problem.

Data file describing a TSP instance in tsp.txt

First line indicates number of cities.
Each city is a point in a plane, each line describes x and y coordinates of a single city

Distance between cities (x,y) and (z,w) defined as Euclidean distance sqrt((x-y)^2 + (y-w)^2).

Return the minimum cost of a traveling salesman tour, rounded down to nearest integer.
