QuickSort.txt contains all integers between 1 and 10,000 (inclusive, no repeats), in unsorted order.

The integer in the ith row of the file gives the ith entry of an input array

Compute the total number of comparisons used to sort the input file by QuickSort.

When there is a recursive call on a subarray of length m, add m-1 to the running total of comparisons

1. Use first element of the array as the pivot element

2. Use final element of the array as the pivot element

3. Use the median-of-three pivot rule:
For even length - for n length, use n/2 element
For odd length - use the middle element, n/2 + 1
