Shortened from Coursera:

The file describes an undirected graph with integer edge costs.

File format:
[number of nodes][number of edges]
[one node of edge 1][other node of edge 1][edge cost]
[one node of edge 2][other node of edge 2][edge cost]
...

Edge costs can be positive or negative, and can be non distinct

Run Prim's minimum spanning tree algorithm on this graph and report the overall cost of a minimum spanning tree (may be negative).
