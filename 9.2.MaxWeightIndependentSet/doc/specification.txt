Shortened from Coursera:

Code up the dynamic programming algorithm for computing a maximum-weight independent set of a path graph.

The file 'mwis.txt' describes the weights of vertices in a path graph (in order) and has the format:

[number of vertices]

[weight of vertice 1]

[weight of vertice 2]

...

Run the dynamic programming algorithm and the reconstruction procedure on the data set.

Q: Of the vertices 1, 2, 3, 4, 17, 117, 517, and 997, which ones belong to the maximum-weight independent set?
Return this as a 8-bit string, e.g. if only 997 belongs, return '00000001'
