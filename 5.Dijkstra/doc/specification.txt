Shortened from Coursera:

The file contains an adjacency list representation of an undirected weighted graph with 200 vertices labeled 1 to 200. Each row consists of the node tuples that are adjacent to that particular vertex along with the length of that edge.

e.g. "1 2,100 3,200" indicates that there is an edge between vertices 1 and 2 that has distance 100, and an edge between vertices 1 and 3 that has distance 200.

The task is to run Dijkstra's shortest-path algorithm on this graph, using 1 (the first vertex) as the source vertex, and to compute the shortest-path distances between 1 and every other vertex of the graph.
