Clustering
----------

Greedy Algorithm outline:
- Initially, each point in a separate cluster
- Repeat until only k clusters:
  - let p, q = closest pair of separated points (determines the current spacing)
  - merge the clusters containing p & q into a single cluster.

Note: Just like Kruskal's MST algorithm, but stopped early.
