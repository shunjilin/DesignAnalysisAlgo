Clustering
----------

Greedy Algorithm outline:
- Initially, each point in a separate cluster
- Repeat until only k clusters:
  - let p, q = closest pair of separated points (determines the current spacing)
  - merge the clusters containing p & q into a single cluster.

Note: Just like Kruskal's MST algorithm, but stopped early.

Data structure for merging: The Union-Find Data Structure

---------
Specifics
---------

For this problem only have to merge clusters of hamming distance 1, followed by 2.

Do that by finding all permutations of dist 1 and 2 nodes relative to each node in the file, and merging them if the permutations exist in the file.

This can be done quickly by using a set data structure to store all node entries.

Any additional optimization is to only generate permutations greater than the respective nodes, to avoid duplicate comparisons.
