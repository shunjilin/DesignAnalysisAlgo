Shortened from Coursera:

Implement algorithm for 2SAT problem. 6 different 2SAT instances given in files '2sat1.txt', '2sat2.txt', ... , '2sat6.txt'

File format:
In each instance, the number of variables and the number of clauses is the same; this number is specified on the first line of the files.
Subsequent lines specifies a clause via its two literals, with a number denoting the variable and a "-" sign denoting logical "not".

Task:
Determine which of the 6 instances are satisfiable, and which are unsatisfiable. Return a 6-bit string where the ith bit should be 1 if the the ith instance is satisfiable.
