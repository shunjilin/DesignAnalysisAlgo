Kosaraju's Algorithm : Psuedocode
-----------------------------------------

Run DFS_firstPass on reversed graph
- repeat DFS on unexplored node
- in each DFS, when hit dead end (no more unexplored nodes on edges),
  assign order (in decreasing order)

Run DFS_secondPass on original graph
- run DFS repeatedly on unexplored nodes, in increasing order
- the node DFS is run on is called the leader of the SCC
- assign grouping to nodes in the same SCC (within the same DFS)
