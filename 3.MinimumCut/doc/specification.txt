Shortened from Coursera:

The file contains the adjacency list representation of a simple undirected graph. There are 200 vertices labeled 1 to 200.

The first column in the file represents the vertex label, and the particular row (other entries except the first column) tells all the vertices that the vertex is adjacent to.

Run the randomized contraction algorithm for the min cut problem and use it on the above graph to compute the min cut.
