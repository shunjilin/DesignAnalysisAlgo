2-SUM Algorithm Variant

Data structures used:

1. Container that supports binary search (std::set)
> To store input integers

2. Hash Table (std::unordered_set)
> To insert and keep track of unique target values

1. For each input integer x:
1.1. Using binary search, and subtracting from the upper and lower bounds, find the range of possible values that the matching integer y can take on. Return iterators to the lower and upper bound of the set.
1.2. Iterate through this range, and if x and y are unique, insert the target value t = x + y into the hash table. The hash table will ensure that duplicate entries are removed.

2. Count the number of entries in the hash table, and output that value.
