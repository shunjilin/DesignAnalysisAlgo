Shortened from Coursera:

The text file contains a list of the integers from 1 to 10000 in unsorted order; you should treat this as a stream of numbers, arriving one by one.

For each input, calculate the median of the numbers accumulated so far.

Sum all 10000 medians, and output the modulo 10000 of this sum.
