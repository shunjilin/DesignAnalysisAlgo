Median Maintenance
------------------

Using two heaps: Left Max Heap and Right Min Heap

On reading new input integer (by advancing the index), insert into appropriate Heap:
> If integer is greater than top of Right Min Heap, insert into Right Min Heap
> Otherwise insert into Left Max Heap

Maintain invariant that Left Max Heap is always equal or 1 size bigger than Right Min Heap.
> If not, adjust sizes by popping off top of an oversized heap and inserting into the other heap.

With the invariant maintained, one can find the running median by just looking at the top of the Left Min Heap.
