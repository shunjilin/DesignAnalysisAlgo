Greedy Heuristic for TSP
------------------------

From an initial vertice, take the edge that has the lowest cost amongst all the edges to not yet visited vertices.

Repeat until all vertices visited, then take the edge from the final vertice to the initial vertice.

---------------------------------------------------
Naive Implementation for Coordinate-based distances
---------------------------------------------------
- Maintain a set of unvisited vertices
- Set the current vertice to that of the initial vertice
- Start with the initial vertice, and remove it from the unvisited set
- Iterate through all vertices in the unvisited set to find the vertice with the closest euclidean distance (calculate on the fly)
- Add this distance to the total distance
- Remove the target vertie from the unvisited set
- Set the current vertice to that of the newly visited vertice
- Continue until all vertices visited, then add the distance from the final vertice to the initial vertice
