Shortened from Coursera:

Implement one or more algorithms for the all-pairs-shortest-path problem.

Files describing three graphs: g1.txt, g2.txt, g3.txt

First line indicates number of vertices and edges,
subsequent lines describe an edge (tail, head) and its length

Note: graphs may or may not have negative-cost cycles

Task: compute the shortest shortest path for each graph
